## About

**eqbank** is a project designed to facilitate the creation, management, and retrieval of questions and equations (or “question bank”) in a web-based interface.  
It supports storing question data, rendering them, and optionally serving them via a web frontend.

_(You can replace the above with a more precise description: e.g. school exam system, practice questions, etc.)_

## Features

- CRUD operations for questions / equations  
- Store question metadata (title, text, answers, difficulty, etc.)  
- Web UI for listing / browsing / searching questions  
- Data persistence using SQLite (or your chosen DB)  
- API endpoints (if any)  
- Template-based rendering (if using Django / Flask / similar)  

## Tech Stack

- **Backend / Framework**: (e.g. Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (as visible in repository)  
- **Frontend / Templates**: HTML, CSS, (optionally JavaScript)  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML  
- **Other dependencies**: as listed in `requirements.txt`
